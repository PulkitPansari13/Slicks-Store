#### Setting up environment variables:
All the private keys are stored in a separate `.env` file to protect sensitive information.
1. First rename the `.template_env` to `.env`. The file follows the syntax:
``` 
KEY=YourAwesomeKey  --without any quotes.
```
2. `SECRET_KEY` is required or else the server won't start, you can grab one from [here](https://djecrety.ir/) or generate one locally following this [guide](https://humberto.io/blog/tldr-generate-django-secret-key/).
3. This project uses Cloudinary for media storage, you can signup to obtain keys or else you can remove the `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` and `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` settings from `settings.py` file to serve media locally.
4. If you are using the default SQLite3 database you can leave the DATABASE related values blank or else specify them.
5. EMAIL related values can be blank, it won't cause error but if you do want to send emails on signup and successful order, specify them.
6. For reCaptcha to work correctly specify the keys which you can create from [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) and select the type as v2.
7. For payments, create an account on razorpay and create a new api key. Copy the same to the respective razorpay variables
